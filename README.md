Without the mentioned files the project cannot be run. The files can be downloaded from the internet searching <code>freeglut</code> for codeblocks. If the following criteria is met just open the <code>Lunaris.cbp</code> in your codeblocks and run.</p>

<h3>Alternative ways to run</h3>

<h3>Lunaris</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Lunaris a imaginary desolate and frozen world, resembling the moon in its barren beauty. The surface is covered in a layer of rocks and frosty dust, giving the landscape a reddish-blue tint that glimmers in the pale light. The terrain is rugged, with craters and rocky formations creating a stark and alien panorama. There are tall, crystalline towers reach towards the sky, capturing and harnessing the abundant energy from the star, advanced transportation system, magnetic levitation trains whiz silently between cities at incredible speeds, connecting research hubs and urban centers with efficiency and precision. The planet has been scientifically developed by residents. The Earth can also seen in the far away location.
